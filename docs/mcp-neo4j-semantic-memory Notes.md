# Creating a base (semantic) ontology

The point of creating Base Semantic Ontologies is to allow natural language semantics to more easily associate with existing objects in memory and to have a semantic relationship between those memories.

- This request requires a "subject" parameter such as... 
  - "Scientific Papers"
  - "Rust Programming"
  - "Node Project"
  - "Python Project"
  - "New Idea"
  - "Projects"
  - "Timelines"
  - "Tools"
  - "Email"
  - etc...
- The base ontology is requested, and generated by the calling LLM via the MCP callback.
  - The request will be something like...<br>
    "Create a Base Semantic Ontology for `<Subject>` including semantic entities an potential relationships between those entities. generate a JSON response listing the entities, and potential entity-relationship-entity pairs."
  - We should also check first, if an existing base ontology, that fits the `<subject>` already exists and report back, as we don't want to over pollute the graph with base ontologies.
  - The base ontology entity and its entity subset is persisted to the graph as nodes where the base ontologies entities (child nodes) point to the base ontology (parent node) via "isA" relationships.
  - The within base ontology node we persist the the JSON struct of it's sub-entities and the various potential (entity-relationship-entity) ERE's that are possible.
  - We also check to see of the new Base Ontology is either a parent or a child of an existing Base Ontology, and we request that appropriate associations are made. This allows one to create a hierarchy of Base Semantic Ontologies.
- This can be done via one call-back to the LLM to generate appropriate cypher queries.
- Base ontologies can be created on the fly for objects as they come in, if one does not already exist.
